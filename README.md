# 🧘 Digital Wellness Dashboard (Tableau Project)

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is an interactive, multi-page dashboard built in **Tableau** to analyze the complex relationship between technology use and personal well-being.

The dashboard transforms a raw dataset of 5,000 user responses into actionable insights. It navigates from a high-level executive summary to deep-dive analyses of specific "Digital Stressors" (like work and social media) and "Wellness Factors" (like sleep and exercise). The goal is to identify key patterns and answer the question: *How do our digital habits affect our mental health?*

## 💾 Dataset Context

This dataset explores the connection between daily technology use and overall well-being. It includes data on screen time, device habits, lifestyle choices (diet, caffeine), and mental health scores, providing a holistic view of modern digital life.
